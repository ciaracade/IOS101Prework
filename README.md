## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Navigating controllers and things like UI components to be handled on the ViewComponents file was a bit
of a challenge. Otherwise, I really like the simplicity that Swift adds to building IOS apps.

### App Idea

    I'd like to create an app that solves the problem of not knowing exactly what to wear everyday. I'm hypersensitive
    and sometimes, even when given the weather, I can get annoyed by the clothes I'm wearing because its not suitable
    for the outfit I'm wearing. This app with allow users to take pictures of their entire closet and categorize the
    clothes into their respective clothing category (sweater, jacket, coat,, rain boots, etc) and given the weather for that day, give options on outfits. This can be calibrated using outfits that the person has previously worn the previous days and what users with similar clothing has worn for that specific temperature. My app will utilize to weather API availible to use by everyone, and implement a scroll feature so User's can choose other options for clothes.
